base64Stream
============

Correctly encode any streamed content into base64 (Node.js)

Based upon https://github.com/mikeal/morestreams

## Why?

Because base64 encodes chunks of 3 bytes at a time, and simply adds a special character (=) to the end in case the number of bytes in the Buffer to be encoded isn't even (in this case even refers to dividable by 3), you can't simply add .toString('base64') when data is emitted. The special character should only occur in the end of the streamed content, and thus you'll have to check every chunk of data streamed and make sure it consist of an even number of bytes, any bytes above will have to be pushed to the beginning of the next chunk and encoded with it. This lib takes care of this for you and simply converts your content into properly base64 encoded content.

## Example: Encode a file to base64
```
var base64Stream = require('base64Stream');

var stream = new base64Stream.BufferedStreamToBase64();
fs.createReadStream(file.path).pipe(stream);

// Use stream and it will output it's data correctly encoded into base64
```
